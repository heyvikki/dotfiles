 <h4> To be Noted </h4>
 

  
- I use bspwm as my daily life window manager bcuz its super minimal and fulfill my needs. 
- I am using JetBrainsMono and a Custom font called [Iosevka Mayukai](https://github.com/Iosevka-Mayukai/Iosevka-Mayukai).
- [Everblush](https://github.com/mangeshrex/everblush.vim) is a dark and beautiful colorscheme which I've used in my latest rice.
- For GTK3 I use my custom [Everblush theme](https://github.com/mangeshrex/everblush-gtk) made with Phocus/gtk3. Also you might need to modify the theme according to your preference ^-^ 


- I am using tint2 as we as polybar but my default bar is tint2 in bspwm (friendship ends with polybar ;-;).
  
- Picom is default one  


#### Installation </h3>


 - Install the following packages 
  
  ```bspwm sxhkd tint2 polybar alacritty nitrogen maim imagemagick.```
